# streamripper-gui

streamripper-gui is a GPL-3-or-later licensed frontend to streamripper, written in python2.

As originally found on [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/streamripper-gui) and [the project's homepage](http://skss.learnfree.eu/archives/3665), it seems pretty much dead (last activity: `2012-09-11`).

The latest version (as of the code available on launchpad's bazaar) is tagged as a release in this repository:octocat:, so it can be accessed more easily.

If i'm interested enough i might port this to python3 some time.

Meawhile, use streamripper's excellent CLI.
